		<h2>What is Detailing?</h2>
		<p>Detailing is a comprehensive cleaning and restoration process for both the interior and exterior of a vehicle. 
		It goes beyond regular car washing by addressing every detail, from washing, polishing, and waxing the exterior to 
		deep cleaning the seats, carpets, and dashboard inside. Detailing helps to maintain your carâ€™s appearance, protect its 
		surfaces from environmental damage, and improve its overall value and longevity.</p>
